# Data Analysis of Recipes and Ratings Dataset

Whether you are a michelin-star chef who works for Hell's Kitchen, or a humble home cook who loves to try out new recipes, we often find ourselves searching for new recipes and wondering what really makes one stand out from the rest. Is it the ingredients involved, the reviews attributed to that recipe, or maybe the macronutrient distributions? We explore this question further as we analyze two datasets of recipes and user interactions from [Food.com](https://www.food.com). 

The data includes both details on the recipe itself, such as the ingredients, nutritional information, and the steps in the recipe; as well as the details on a user's interaction with the recipe including their rating of the recipe, the date in which they submitted their review, and the review itself. With this information, we aim to predict a recipe's average rating based on these features to better understand what makes recipes successful, hoping to provide insight on how recipes can be improved or better tailored ot individual preferences. The end goal of this analysis is to use the results from our predictive models to support smarter food recommendation systems and to offer a data-driven perspective on what makes a recipe truly stand out.

In the table below, we describe the features in our dataset that will be important for our data analysis and model building. This dataset describes two merged datasets that describe the recipe metadata and the user interactions, containing 1,132,367 rows, and the following columns with their corrresponding descriptions.
